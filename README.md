Electricity Bill Calculator
---
This program was developed as part of the coursework for Introduction to Programming, a first-semester course in the Department of Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics. 

This program calculates the electricity bill for a specific region's electricity company, based on the following specifications:

1. Total Bill (ΣΛ): The total bill is calculated as the sum of electricity charges, additional fees, and VAT:
   ΣΛ=ΛHP+ΛT+ΦΠA

2. Calculated using the formula:
   ΛHP=TK+ΠX−ΠΣ−EP+TAΠE

3. Additional Fees (ΛΤ):
   The total additional fees are calculated as:
   ΛT=TNERIT+TAΠ
