Electricity Bill Calculator
---
This program was developed as part of the coursework for Introduction to Programming, a first-semester course in the Department of Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics. 

This program calculates the electricity bill for a specific region's electricity company, based on the following specifications:

1. **Total Bill (ΣΛ):** The total bill is calculated as the sum of electricity charges, additional fees, and VAT
   ΣΛ=ΛHP+ΛT+ΦΠA

2. **Electricity Charges (ΛΗΡ):**
   ΛHP=TK+ΠX−ΠΣ−EP+TAΠE

3. **Additional Fees (ΛΤ):**
   The total additional fees are calculated as:
   ΛT=TNERIT+TAΠ

4. **Rounding:** The final bill (ΣΛ) is rounded to the nearest euro.

5. **Input:** The program accepts user input for ΚΩ, ΠΣ, ΕΡ, and ΕΝΑΝ.

6. **Output:**
   Calculates the bill for 10 users and stores the results in an array.
   Computes the average total bill.
   Sorts the results in ascending order.
